  "readme": "# less-watch\n\nNode process to monitor changes to specified files or directories, and execute\nsome specified action in response.\n\nSettings are stored in `~/.less-watch`\n\nIf some file does not exist, the script will continue to try the other files,\nand retry any inaccessible file every 60 seconds. I do a lot of development on\nremote servers, so the files are only accessible when I have sshfs connected,\nbut I don't want to have to run something to tell my LESS compiler that it\nshould retry the filepath in question.\n\n(This particular feature is not actually in 0.0.2, by the way. It's planned.)\n\n## Installation\n\nFor Mac OS X:\n\n    # cd into this directory\n    touch ~/.less-watch\n    ./install\n\nThis will add the `LessWatch.app` application to the list of applications in your \"login items,\"\nso that it gets started automatically.\n\nAfter running `./install`, either restart your computer or double click `LessWatch.app`.\n\n## `~/.less-watch` format\n\nEach line has a glob (or simple file) on the left of a colon, and a command on\nthe right.\n\nThe command on the right will have the following keywords available:\n\n- {file}, the fullpath of the matching file (usually just the string to the left\n  of the colon).\n- {basename}, the shortname of {file}, without path or extension.\n- {dirname}, the directory containing {file}.\n\n## `~/.less-watch` example\n\n    /Users/chbrown/work/mailmaster/static/css/site.less: cd {dirname} && lessc -C site.less site.css\n    /Volumes/sshfs_drive/app4/static/*.less: cd {dirname} && lessc -C {basename}.less {basename}.css\n\n## License\n\nCopyright © 2012–2013 Christopher Brown.
